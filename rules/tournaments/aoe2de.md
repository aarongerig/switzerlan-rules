### Map Selection Process

#### Swiss Rounds

In the first round, the lower ranked (by 1v1 RM ELO) player has the choice of which map is played.
For the next rounds the player with the lower current ranking in the Swiss round standings chooses the map.

#### Single Elimination

In a best-of-1 match, the lower seeded player chooses the map.
In a best-of-3 match, the first game is always played on Arabia.
Afterward the loser of the previously played game chooses the map.

## Civilization Draft

Players may pick any civilization, but may not repeat any civilization in a match. This means that if, for example,
a match lasts for three games, players will have played three different civilizations each (also known as "hidden pick,
no repeat").
